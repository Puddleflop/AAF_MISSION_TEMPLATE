And Kids, I cannot stress this enough;

SPEND SOME FUCKING TIME OPTIMIZEING YOUR MISSIONS

Take the time to set dress pieces and flavour as simple objects.  purely visual things that will never be touched ?
disable simulation !
SPACE OUT OBJECTIVES
Cacheing is set by default to 1.5 km.  we can use transport vehicles and Helo's, well we can RTB after each Objective.
dont have everythign packed so tightly together everythign is constantly awake.
DYNAMIC SIMULATION
sd unit cacheing is set to 1500 your dynamic sim range should be shorter then that.
IF we all manage to actually take some time and care and optimize things well we may do away with Dynamic sim IN THE FUTURE !

As it stands, ASR_AI is the AI mod running on the server.  That can and will change pending updates, improvements etc etc.
